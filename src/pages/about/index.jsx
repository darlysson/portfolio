            A native New Yorker by way of Manhattan, current New Jerseyan. I've
            spent half of my life moving back and forth between the two, so you
            could say I like the pizza and bagels here enough to stick around.

            I've had a passion for technology and all things nerdy since I was
            first old enough to hold a Game Boy and tinker with my dad's MS-DOS
            work laptop, and that love of software and gadgets has been the core
            of my identity ever since.

            I've also maintained a love of the arts and humanities thanks to
            wonderful parents who took me to museums, plays, and everything
            in-between while growing up. I loved it so much that I pursued a BFA
            from NYU (with a Minor in Web Design and Applications), and have
            spent the past 10 years pursuing acting and voice-over
            professionally in NYC. As an actor and narrator I've worked with
            some amazing clients, such as Audible, Scholastic, Microsoft,
            Blizzard Entertainment, Nickelodeon, and many more.
