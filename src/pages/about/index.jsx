          <p>
            I'm a Brazilian boy currently living in the lovely city of Lisbon,
            Portugal. Being here is all about the sun, good food, good beaches,
            etc. So, yeah, I just love it :)
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm curious, enthusiastic and a student most of the time. Fast
            learner and passionate about <strong>learning new things</strong>,
            especially related to the front-end world and this project is
            evidence of that. Able to switch between perfectionism and
            pragmatism, able and willing to{" "}
            <strong>think outside the box</strong>, and always{" "}
            <u>looking for improvement</u>.
          </p>

              I’m interested in the JamStack (<strong>GatsbyJS</strong> &{" "}
              <strong>Next.js</strong>), CSS, <strong>ReactJS</strong> &{" "}
              <strong>Typescript</strong>.

              Fact about me: I'm a big fan of sports in general, but{" "}
              <strong>football</strong> is special to me. I love to play and
              watch it as much as I can.{" "}

            The quote above is what I have been guided by for the past few
            years, not only for professional matters but for life itself. I have
            concluded that there's a <u>better version of myself</u> and it is{" "}
            <strong>always</strong> <u>outside of my comfort zone</u>. That's
            why is so important to me to keep in mind that whenever I face
            troubles or tricky challenges, in life or at work, it will work for
            my personal growth.{" "}
            <strong>Trouble is always an opportunity to be better.</strong>
